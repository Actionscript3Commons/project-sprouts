*******************************
Ruby LoadError encountered!
*******************************

We have decided to pull all explicit references to RubyGems out of the Project Sprouts source code as per this article:

    http://tomayko.com/writings/require-rubygems-antipattern

In doing so, we seem to have introduced a problem for you.

Here's a detailed description of the problem and some options for solving it:

    http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3#page70

If you just want it FIXED, open up your .bash_profile, .bashrc, or do whatever you do to set
environment variables on your system and add the following:

    # OS X and other *nixes:
    export RUBYOPT=rubygems

    # Windows:
    RUBYOPT=rubygems
