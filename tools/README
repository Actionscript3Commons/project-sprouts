TOOLS
-------------------------

Sprout tools are ruby gems that refer to either universal or platform specific binary files in such a way that enables sprouts to download, install and run the appropriate binary on the appropriate system.

As an added benefit, rubygems makes these binary files available in the system path with very little additional effort.
